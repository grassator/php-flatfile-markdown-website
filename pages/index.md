# ExtremeCSS TextMate Bundle

This bundle is intended for hardcore CSS coders who want to maximize
their productivity. It is originally inspired by
[mCSS bundle](https://github.com/minimaldesign/mCSS.tmbundle)
but it's smarter and more feature-rich:

* Intelligent value and color input
* More snippets to support CSS 3 attributes
* Duplicate rule/selector commands


## Installation

* Load TextMate and disable or remove default CSS bundle
* Open up Terminal.app
* Execute this command:  
  `cd ~/Library/"Application Support"/TextMate/Bundles/`
* If that directory wasn't found, you'll need to create it, then:
* git clone git://github.com/grassator/ExtremeCSS.tmbundle.git "ExtremeCSS.tmbundle"
* Restart TextMate or in menu choose  
  Bundles -> Bundle Editor -> Reload Bundles
